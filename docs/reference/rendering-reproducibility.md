# Rendering and Reproducibility Contract

This exemplar has one rendering paradigm: authored fragments and configuration
produce deterministic data, figures, composed Markdown, hydrated Markdown, PDF,
web, and copied root outputs. Do not hand-edit generated artifacts to make a
claim pass; regenerate the producer that owns the artifact.

## Authored surfaces

- `manuscript/sections/imrad/**` contains editable section fragments.
- `manuscript/sheaf/tracks.yaml` declares fragment types, renderers, and order.
- `manuscript/sheaf/manifest.yaml` binds fragments to IMRAD rows.
- `tracks.yaml` declares pipeline tracks, gates, and extension artifacts.
- `figures.yaml` is the source of truth for figure ids, captions, alt text,
  widths, and section bindings.
- `manuscript/refs/labels.yaml` is intentionally absent; it was a stale second
  figure registry. Figure labels are declared only by `figures.yaml` and
  materialized in `output/figures/figure_registry.json`.
- `pymdp.yaml`, `domain_profile.yaml`, and `data/claim_ledger.yaml` define
  deterministic runtime, domain, and claim-evidence contracts.

## Generated artifacts

- `output/data/*.json` and `output/reports/*.json` are produced by project
  scripts and validation-spine modules.
- `output/data/artifact_contract_index.json` is the canonical cross-artifact
  contract index. It binds generated artifacts to producers, configured scripts,
  pipeline/sheaf lanes, manuscript consumers, claim predicates, validators,
  negative controls, freshness fields, and copied-root parity.
- `manuscript/0*.md`, except hand-authored front/back matter, are composed from
  sheaf fragments by `scripts/compose_manuscript.py`.
- `output/manuscript/*.md` is hydrated from composed manuscript sections plus
  `output/data/manuscript_variables.json`.
- `output/figures/*` comes from `scripts/generate_figures.py` and
  `scripts/render_animation.py`.
- `output/pdf/*` and `output/web/*` are render outputs, not sources of truth.
- Root-level `output/templates/template_active_inference/**` is copied from the
  project-local `output/**` by the root pipeline.

## Single hydration boundary

The single hydration boundary is `scripts/z_generate_manuscript_variables.py`.
Composition may emit `{{token}}` placeholders, but only hydration substitutes
them. Unknown placeholders and single-brace token typos fail closed. Volatile
counts, run facts, semantic restrictions, and figure captions must enter through
`output/data/manuscript_variables.json`, never hard-coded prose.

## Producer order

Run producers in this order when refreshing the full reproducible surface:

```bash
uv run python scripts/compose_manuscript.py
uv run python scripts/run_analytical_sweep.py
uv run python scripts/simulate_si_tmaze.py
uv run python scripts/simulate_si_graph_world.py
uv run python scripts/compute_statistics.py
uv run python scripts/generate_figures.py
uv run python scripts/render_animation.py
uv run python scripts/generate_validation_spine.py
uv run python scripts/generate_toy_sweep_tracks.py
uv run python scripts/generate_formal_interop_tracks.py
uv run python scripts/generate_integration_audit.py
uv run python scripts/generate_sheaf_tracks.py
uv run python scripts/z_generate_manuscript_variables.py
uv run python scripts/generate_method_inventory.py
```

`generate_sheaf_tracks.py` is the canonical consolidation pass. It rewrites the
semantic certificate, dependency graph, provenance, replay, counterexample,
evidence-field, release-bundle, theorem-traceability, gate-index, diffoscope,
proof-extraction, state-space, causal-ablation, license, release-note,
proof-dependency, transition-table, ablation-sensitivity, release-attestation,
artifact-contract, track-improvement, blocked-scope, section-status, render-log,
and visualization quality artifacts.

## Figure rendering contract

Every figure id must exist in `figures.yaml`, have a generator in
`src/visualizations/figures.py`, write through `figure_io.save_figure_png`, and
appear in `output/figures/figure_registry.json`. Figure captions and alt text may
use hydration tokens, but figure numbering belongs to pandoc-crossref. Reused
figures must use unlabeled references rather than duplicate labels.
The appendix theorem-traceability graph, causal-ablation heatmap, and
artifact-contract map are generated from JSON rows and validated by the same
figure registry contract as the main figures.
`output/reports/visualization_quality_audit.json` joins registry metadata,
figure-source mappings, figure hashes, image dimensions, color mode, and
alt/caption lengths into one fail-closed report. It also recomputes the
typography-token contract from `figures.yaml`, rejects raw numeric font-size
literals in the figure source modules, and inventories visual files that are
intentionally outside the numbered registry. Auxiliary outputs such as the
deterministic GIF must be classified and nonblank; unknown visual files fail the
audit instead of silently sharing the output directory. The report marks figures
backed by generated statistical data or report artifacts and fails when those
bridge sources are missing. `output/data/statistical_visualization_bridge.json`
expands those marked rows into a sheaf/scholarship crosswalk with manuscript
sections, registered tracks, statistical source links, and the manuscript
sections that actually reference each statistically backed figure. Each
referenced section is resolved back through `manuscript/sheaf/manifest.yaml`,
and validation requires the section to carry a `visualization` track binding.

## Sheaf reproducibility

The sheaf claim is finite and falsifiable:

- registry tracks must be known and typed by renderer;
- manifest bindings must resolve to existing fragments or generated renderers;
- coverage must have zero gray cells on a clean tree;
- semantic gluing must record shared symbols, claim evidence, artifact
  producers, consumers, validation gates, and manuscript variables;
- every promoted artifact must have a producer, a bound manuscript track, a
  typed claim, a validation restriction, and a negative-control test.
- the artifact-contract index must rederive row completeness and copied-output
  parity from rows, not aggregate booleans alone.

## Root output parity

Project-local outputs are authoritative during generation. After a root pipeline
run, verify copied root output parity as well:

```bash
./run.sh --project templates/template_active_inference --pipeline --core-only
uv run python scripts/validate_outputs.py
```

The semantic and release-bundle reports allow render-deferred PDF/web rows before
copy, but final acceptance must inspect both `output/**` inside the project and
`../../output/templates/template_active_inference/**` from the repository root.
