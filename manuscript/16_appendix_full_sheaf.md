# Appendix: full track coverage {#sec:appendix_full_sheaf}

<!-- sheaf-track:prose -->

This section is the **composability proof** for the manifest-indexed sheaf model: all {{appendix_sheaf_track_count}} appendix-bound fragment tracks render into one flat manuscript section without section-specific compose branches. The registry defines {{sheaf_track_count}} composable types; optional `layers` is methods-only and excluded from this row. The `animation` fragment is bound here as an optional registry type alongside the live proof, simulation, formal, notation, validation-spine, integration, audit, finite-catalog, ablation, license, release-evidence, scholarship, assumption-index, delta, and staleness tracks.

The proof is a publication-systems check ([@eq:appendix_track_count]). It demonstrates that heterogeneous fragments share one registry, manifest, renderer dispatch path, coverage matrix, and hydration boundary; it does not assert that every track carries equal scientific weight.

<!-- sheaf-track:formalism -->

For each track $t \in \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Full}}$, the appendix row binds a fragment path $f(t)$ and the composer emits `<!-- sheaf-track:t -->` before the rendered body. Generated renderers such as `section_figures` and markdown renderers pass through the same `resolve_track_body()` dispatch, so the appendix exercises the common compose interface rather than a bespoke appendix path.

$$
|\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Full}}| = {{appendix_sheaf_track_count}}
$$ {#eq:appendix_track_count}

The fragment registry defines {{sheaf_track_count}} composable track types; optional `layers` is bound on the methods sheaf section only. Optional `animation` is bound in this appendix proof; the deterministic GIF artifact in `tracks.yaml` `extension_tracks` is produced by the core analysis DAG and remains separate from this fragment slot.

Because this appendix binds every non-optional appendix track plus optional `animation`, it is the maximal publication stalk of the coverage presheaf and exercises every publication renderer through the common `resolve_track_body()` dispatch. The same compose path is gated by the {{sheaf_law_count}} sheaf laws verified in [@sec:methods_sheaf] ({{sheaf_laws_verified}}/{{sheaf_law_count}} satisfied): the appendix section glues to a unique output (separation), occupies the terminal position of the linear extension under its own `appendix` group row (poset and gluing), binds only well-typed fragments (typing), and owns every fragment path it references (compositionality). No count in this appendix is hand-written; all are injected from the registry-backed oracle.

<!-- sheaf-track:simulation -->

Analytical sweep artifacts feed [@sec:results_mi_sweep] and [@sec:results_invariants]; simulation invariants merge after [@sec:results_si_tmaze]. No additional path listing is required beyond those Results sections.

<!-- sheaf-track:assumption_index -->

The appendix `assumption_index` row points to
`output/data/analytical_assumption_index.json`. It binds
{{analytical_assumption_count}} finite Bernoulli-Ising assumption rows to
{{analytical_equation_count}} equation identifiers and generated artifacts, with
indexed status `{{analytical_assumptions_indexed}}`.

The point is to make analytical signposting mechanical. If an equation is added
without an assumption row, or if a row loses its evidence artifact, the index
gate fails and the manuscript cannot present the equation as part of the
validated finite toy proof surface.

<!-- sheaf-track:pymdp -->

pymdp harness summary: `output/data/si_tmaze_summary.json` (mean belief entropy, action trace). Runtime diagnostics: `output/reports/pymdp_runtime_diagnostics.json` (known warnings {{pymdp_runtime_known_warning_count}}, unexpected warnings {{pymdp_runtime_unexpected_warning_count}}). Policy posterior grid: `output/data/pymdp_policy_posterior_grid.json` ({{pymdp_policy_posterior_row_count}} rows). Full log: `output/logs/pymdp_runs.jsonl`.

<!-- sheaf-track:interop -->

`sheaf-track:interop` binds `output/data/interop_roundtrip_report.json`, `output/data/gnn_roundtrip_report.json`, `output/reports/gnn_lint_report.json`, and ontology profile artifacts into the appendix proof row. The appendix claim is exactly {{interop_check_count}} checks with lossless status `{{interop_all_lossless}}`.

<!-- sheaf-track:provenance -->

The appendix provenance fragment points to `output/data/artifact_provenance.json`, the canonical artifact that records required toy artifact hashes, producer scripts, source commit, deterministic seeds, config digests, and {{provenance_bundle_count}} bundle rows.

<!-- sheaf-track:replay_matrix -->

`replay_matrix.json` provides the appendix proof for deterministic replay: {{replay_matrix_row_count}} producer replay/fingerprint rows with matched status `{{replay_matrix_all_matched}}`.

<!-- sheaf-track:counterexample -->

The appendix counterexample fragment points to
`output/reports/counterexample_matrix.json`, the expected-failure matrix that
keeps promoted validation gates falsifiable. It currently records
{{counterexample_count}} known-bad fixtures, and the hydrated pass flag is
`{{counterexample_all_known_bad_fail}}`, meaning those fixtures are expected to
fail rather than sneak through a positive-control gate.

This row is the negative-control ledger for the sheaf. Each counterexample names
a promoted track, target validation gate, mutation, and observed expected-failure
status. A new live track without a counterexample row is therefore visibly
incomplete in the track-improvement scope.

<!-- sheaf-track:adversarial_audit -->

`sheaf-track:adversarial_audit` binds `output/reports/adversarial_audit.json`, `output/reports/scope_boundary_audit.json`, and claim-audit outputs. The appendix claim is exactly {{adversarial_audit_count}} expected-failure rows with documented status `{{adversarial_audit_all_documented}}` and known-bad-passing count {{adversarial_known_bad_passed}}.

<!-- sheaf-track:evidence_fields -->

`evidence_field_index.json` provides the appendix proof for field-level claim evidence: {{evidence_field_count}} mapped fields with status `{{evidence_fields_mapped}}`.

<!-- sheaf-track:release_bundle -->

`release_bundle_manifest.json` provides the appendix proof for required deliverables: {{release_bundle_artifact_count}} artifacts with source-present status `{{release_bundle_sources_present}}`.

`artifact_contract_index.json` is the appendix-level cross-artifact concordance proof. It rederives {{artifact_contract_row_count}} rows from the live semantic producer map and release-bundle parity rows, with row-complete flag `{{artifact_contract_complete}}` and copied-parity flag `{{artifact_contract_copied_parity_complete}}`.

<!-- sheaf-track:gate_ergonomics -->

`validation_gate_index.json` provides the appendix proof for gate ergonomics: {{validation_gate_index_count}} indexed gates. `track_lane_matrix.json` adds {{track_lane_matrix_row_count}} pipeline-to-sheaf rows with completion flag `{{track_lane_matrix_complete}}`.

<!-- sheaf-track:artifact_diffoscope -->

### Appendix track: artifact diffoscope

`artifact_diffoscope` binds `output/reports/artifact_diffoscope.json` into the
full sheaf appendix. Rows: {{artifact_diffoscope_row_count}}. All equal:
`{{artifact_diffoscope_all_equal}}`.

This diffoscope is deliberately narrow and reproducibility-facing. For each
non-cyclic generated artifact, it compares the saved provenance digest to the
live file digest at validation time. The validator re-derives equality from the
rows, so a stale `all_equal: true` summary cannot hide one changed artifact.

The row count is not a decoration; it is the number of artifact fingerprints
that survived cycle exclusion and therefore can be compared directly. This
keeps the release bundle honest about mutable files while avoiding
self-referential hashes for artifacts that necessarily include their own
provenance.

<!-- sheaf-track:artifact_license -->

### Appendix track: artifact license

`artifact_license` binds `output/reports/artifact_license_audit.json` into the
full sheaf appendix. Rows: {{artifact_license_row_count}}. All safe:
`{{artifact_license_all_safe}}`.

The license audit classifies each generated or source-backed artifact under the
public exemplar's configured license boundary. It is intentionally conservative:
generated local outputs and project-owned source files pass, while an artifact
outside those public source kinds would need an explicit provenance and license
row before it could support a manuscript claim.

This is also where the blocked empirical-adapter boundary matters. Private,
restricted, or network-derived data are not smuggled in as evidence; they remain
blocked until privacy, licensing, typed-claim, semantic, and negative-control
gates are implemented in the same artifact path.

<!-- sheaf-track:scholarship -->

`sheaf-track:scholarship` binds `output/data/scholarship_source_matrix.json` into
the appendix proof row. The appendix claim is exactly
{{scholarship_source_count}} connected source rows with connected status
`{{scholarship_sources_connected}}`; each row names a bibliography key, locator,
manuscript citation status, declared consumer sections, method role, registered
track set, evidence artifact, and claim-boundary statement. The row set includes
{{scholarship_quantitative_method_role_count}} quantitative/statistical or
visualization-quality method roles, including {{visualization_statistics_backed_count}}
statistically backed figures with bridge status
`{{visualization_statistics_bridge_ok}}`. The explicit crosswalk has
{{statistical_visualization_bridge_row_count}} rows and
{{statistical_visualization_bridge_source_count}} statistical source links; every
row is referenced in the manuscript
(`{{statistical_visualization_bridge_all_referenced}}`), and every such
reference section is manifest-bound to sheaf tracks
(`{{statistical_visualization_bridge_references_sheaf_bound}}`) with a
visualization track present
(`{{statistical_visualization_bridge_references_visualization_bound}}`). This
binds statistics and figure-quality claims to generated artifacts rather than
bibliography authority. The scholarship matrix itself also records manuscript
citation presence (`{{scholarship_citations_present}}`), declared-section
citation overlap count
({{scholarship_declared_section_citation_overlap_count}}), scope-guarded
boundaries (`{{scholarship_claim_boundaries_scope_guarded}}`), and live row
re-derivation (`{{scholarship_rows_rederived}}`), which makes forged aggregate
source-connectivity flags fail at the validation boundary.

The visualization registry is also now a paper-integration object: role metadata
complete `{{visualization_intent_metadata_complete}}`, paper claims complete
`{{visualization_paper_claims_complete}}`, and section bindings complete
`{{visualization_figures_section_bound}}`. Those flags are read from the saved
visualization-quality audit and then rechecked through the semantic sheaf
restrictions.

<!-- sheaf-track:security_posture -->

The appendix includes the security posture as a release-boundary proof object.
Each row in `output/reports/security_posture_audit.json` has evidence artifacts,
validators, a scoped boundary statement, and a negative-control identifier. The
negative controls target the verifier failure modes a well-resourced adversary
would prefer: aggregate forgery, untracked credentials, network-derived evidence,
private-data leakage, unsigned production-release claims, and production
zero-trust claims without a runtime identity plane.

The posture is therefore defensive and local: it hardens this public template
against evidence laundering, artifact drift, secret exposure, and false release
claims while keeping production-only controls deferred until a real deployment
adds signed provenance, SBOMs, identity-aware access, telemetry, and incident
response evidence.

<!-- sheaf-track:sensitivity -->

`sheaf-track:sensitivity` binds `output/data/sensitivity_sweep.json`, measured `output/data/si_policy_grid.json`, compatibility-named EFE values artifact `output/data/si_efe_terms.json`, `output/data/analytical_observable_sweep.json`, and graph-world topology artifacts including `output/data/si_graph_world_topology_traces.json`. The appendix claim is exactly {{sensitivity_cell_count}} complete canonical grid cells.

<!-- sheaf-track:uncertainty -->

`sheaf-track:uncertainty` binds `output/data/uncertainty_summary.json`. The appendix claim is exactly {{uncertainty_row_count}} normalized rows across {{uncertainty_bin_count}} entropy bins with status `{{uncertainty_all_normalized}}`.

<!-- sheaf-track:benchmark -->

`sheaf-track:benchmark` binds `output/data/toy_benchmark_matrix.json`. The appendix claim is exactly {{benchmark_model_count}} complete toy-model rows with status `{{benchmark_all_models_complete}}`.

<!-- sheaf-track:manuscript_staleness -->

The appendix `manuscript_staleness` row points to
`output/reports/manuscript_staleness_report.json`. It checks
{{manuscript_staleness_row_count}} token bindings after hydration, including late
audit variables, and the pass flag is `{{manuscript_staleness_all_fresh}}`.

This is the rendered-output side of the sheaf contract. Source fragments may
contain hydration placeholders, but the public manuscript must not; the staleness report
compares each token's generated value against the resolved markdown so stale
counts are caught after composition, not only during source-file linting.

Generated from `output/data/sheaf_coverage_matrix.json`.*

<!-- sheaf-track:lean -->

Lean modules under `lean/TemplateActiveInference/` declare horizon and coupling witnesses. Build with `lake build` in `lean/`; [@fig:lean_boundary_status] summarizes proved versus deferred statements for this boundary fragment.

<!-- sheaf-track:model_checking -->

`sheaf-track:model_checking` binds `output/reports/model_checking_witnesses.json` and the Lean theorem inventories. The appendix claim is exactly {{model_checking_witness_count}} finite exhaustive witnesses with pass status `{{model_checking_all_passed}}`; Lean graph-world topology coverage is {{lean_graph_world_topology_witness_count}} generated topology ids with all-witnessed flag `{{lean_graph_world_all_topologies_witnessed}}`.

<!-- sheaf-track:theorem_traceability -->

`theorem_traceability_matrix.json` provides the appendix proof for theorem traceability: {{theorem_traceability_row_count}} linked rows with status `{{theorem_traceability_linked}}`.

<!-- sheaf-track:proof_extraction -->

### Appendix track: proof extraction

`proof_extraction` binds `output/data/proof_extraction_index.json` into the full
sheaf appendix. Extracted theorems: {{proof_extraction_theorem_count}}.
Constructive status: `{{proof_extraction_all_constructive}}`.

The extraction index is intentionally modest: it records theorem names,
statements, source files, leading tactics, and forbidden proof-token checks.
That makes the Lean boundary inspectable without pretending that every proof
term has been translated into a proof object. A row with a missing statement or
forbidden token fails the formal interop gate and the canonical sheaf gate.

`output/data/proof_dependency_graph.json` adds the dependency view used by the
appendix figure. It contributes {{proof_dependency_edge_count}} theorem-source,
theorem-tactic, theorem-definition, and theorem-witness edges, with resolved
edge status `{{proof_dependency_all_resolved}}`; this is the artifact that keeps
the theorem-traceability graph tied to generated Lean and model-checking rows.

<!-- sheaf-track:state_space_catalog -->

### Appendix track: state-space catalog

`state_space_catalog` binds `output/data/state_space_catalog.json` into the full
sheaf appendix. Rows: {{state_space_catalog_row_count}}. All finite:
`{{state_space_catalog_all_finite}}`.

The catalog is the finite-scope boundary for every toy claim in the exemplar.
Each row records a model id, state count, action count, policy count, source
artifact, and finite flag; the validator recomputes that counts are positive
and that every row remains finite. This prevents a manuscript sentence about
exhaustive checking from silently drifting into an unbounded or empirical
setting.

`output/data/state_transition_table.json` makes the boundary operational. It
contains {{state_transition_row_count}} deterministic transition rows and covers
all reachable finite models with status `{{state_transition_all_covered}}`.
Readers can therefore audit not just the number of states, but the actual
state/action/next-state relation used by the model-checking witnesses.

<!-- sheaf-track:causal_ablation -->

### Appendix track: causal ablation

`causal_ablation` binds `output/data/causal_ablation_matrix.json` into the full
sheaf appendix. Cells: {{causal_ablation_row_count}}. Complete grid:
`{{causal_ablation_complete_grid}}`.

The matrix is a finite teaching device: every row names a topology, a coupling
value, a perturbation, a scalar effect, and the generated source row that made
the effect admissible. It is not a claim about empirical interventions. It
shows how an intervention-shaped table can be made falsifiable inside the sheaf:
delete one perturbation cell or clear one deterministic flag and the grid gate
fails before the manuscript can reuse the result.

`output/reports/ablation_sensitivity_report.json` then joins those ablation
effects to the sensitivity and uncertainty artifacts. The report contributes
{{ablation_sensitivity_row_count}} source-backed rows, with source-backed status
`{{ablation_sensitivity_source_backed}}`, so the appendix heatmap is a rendered
view of validated JSON rather than a decorative restatement.

<!-- sheaf-track:gnn -->

GNN declarations: `gnn/bernoulli_toy.gnn.md` and `gnn/si_tmaze.gnn.md` [@gnn2023]. [@fig:gnn_ontology_concordance] and [@sec:methods_analytical] document ontology concordance for the Bernoulli toy; SI notation extends the same pattern under [@sec:methods_pymdp].

<!-- sheaf-track:ontology -->

### Ontology bindings

- `belief_entropy` → **BeliefEntropy**
- `expected_free_energy` → **ExpectedFreeEnergy**
- `location` → **HiddenState**
- `observation` → **ObservationLikelihood**
- `policy` → **PolicyPosterior**
- `sheaf_track` → **SheafFragment**


<!-- sheaf-track:animation -->

Animation is an **extension** sheaf track backed by a deterministic GIF from `scripts/render_animation.py`. This appendix row documents the track binding only; default publication still uses static SI figures ([@sec:results_si_tmaze], [@fig:si_tmaze_actions]) while the GIF remains an auditable generated artifact.

<!-- sheaf-track:animation_delta -->

The appendix `animation_delta` row points to `output/data/animation_frame_deltas.json`. The manifest records {{animation_delta_count}} adjacent-frame deltas, with `{{animation_deltas_all_nonzero}}` as the hydrated evidence that the GIF is trace-derived rather than a duplicated static frame.

<!-- sheaf-track:release_notes -->

### Appendix track: release notes evidence

`release_notes` binds `output/reports/release_notes_evidence.json` into the full
sheaf appendix. Rows: {{release_notes_row_count}}. Source-backed:
`{{release_notes_source_backed}}`.

Release notes are treated as claims, not as informal changelog prose. Each row
names a source artifact and a pass/deferred status, so the release note can say
only what validation, bundle, or semantic artifacts support. The validator
re-derives support from rows; flipping the summary bit without fixing a failed
row still fails.

`output/reports/release_attestation.json` is the compact final view over the
same boundary. It records {{release_attestation_row_count}} attestation rows for
validation, release bundle hash, license audit, semantic certificate, and
blocked-scope status, with all-attested flag `{{release_attestation_all_attested}}`.
