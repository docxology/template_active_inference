# Bernoulli–Ising analytical model {#sec:methods_analytical}

<!-- sheaf-track:prose -->

The analytical method is a finite **K={{bernoulli_state_count}} Bernoulli / Ising** oracle. The entangled joint [@eq:entangled_joint] gives closed-form mutual information $I(\lambda)$; `output/data/parameter_sweep.csv` then checks the same curve by an independent exact total-correlation recomputation before the value is used in [@sec:results_mi_sweep]. GNN and ontology rows share the same symbol surface ([@fig:gnn_ontology_concordance]), so the derivation, sweep, and model notation are one audited toy contract rather than parallel descriptions.

The scope is intentionally small: finite variational quantities only, no sampling, and no empirical generalization. "Free energy" here means exactly computed variational functionals on this tiny discrete state-space, aligned with mathematical FEP reviews [@buckley2017mathreview], not continuous-time or biological FEP dynamics [@gershman2019fepbrain]. The generated sweep contains {{param_sweep_grid_points}} grid points, and the merged invariant report records {{invariants_passed}} / {{invariants_total}} passing checks.

<!-- sheaf-track:formalism -->

The entangled joint over binary policies satisfies

$$
q_\lambda(\pi) \propto E(\pi)\,\exp(\lambda J(\pi)),
$$ {#eq:entangled_joint}

with symmetric Ising coupling $J$ and deformation parameter $\lambda$. Let $\sigma(\lambda)=q_\lambda(\pi_1=\pi_2)$ be the probability that the two streams agree (the diagonal mass of the $2\times2$ joint); by symmetry both marginals are uniform. With binary entropy $H_b(p)=-p\log p-(1-p)\log(1-p)$ in nats, the joint entropy is $H(q_\lambda)=\log 2 + H_b(\sigma(\lambda))$ while each marginal contributes $\log 2$, so the mutual information is

$$
I(\lambda)=\sum_k H(q_k)-H(q_\lambda)=\log 2 - H_b(\sigma(\lambda)),
$$

vanishing at $\lambda=0$ ($\sigma=\tfrac12$, independent streams) and saturating at $\log 2$ as $\lambda\to\infty$ ($\sigma\to1$, perfectly entangled). These symbols are the rows of `analytical_assumption_index.json`, so the derivation is auditable rather than asserted.

<!-- sheaf-track:simulation -->

The analytical track writes a parameter sweep comparing closed-form mutual information with an independent exact recomputation of it (via total correlation) across $\lambda \in [0, {{lambda_max}}]$ on {{param_sweep_grid_points}} grid points ([@sec:results_mi_sweep], [@fig:ising_mi_curve]).

<!-- sheaf-track:assumption_index -->

The `assumption_index` fragment makes the analytical equations inspectable as a generated artifact instead of relying on prose labels. `output/data/analytical_assumption_index.json` indexes {{analytical_equation_count}} finite-model equation identifiers and {{analytical_assumption_count}} rows; the hydrated pass flag is `{{analytical_assumptions_indexed}}`.

The index is deliberately narrow. It covers the Bernoulli-Ising toy equations, their finite binary state assumptions, and the generated artifacts that test the same symbols. Any missing equation identifier or empty assumption list fails the toy-sweep validation gate.

<!-- sheaf-track:gnn -->

The Bernoulli toy is declared in `gnn/bernoulli_toy.gnn.md` ({{gnn_spec_version}}), following the GNN notation role described by Smekal and Friedman [@gnn2023]. [@fig:gnn_ontology_concordance] links GNN variables to Active Inference Ontology terms bound in the analytical ontology fragment; round-trip parity is checked before render.

Measured MI and sweep artifacts in [@sec:results_mi_sweep] ground the same symbol map used in the concordance diagram.
