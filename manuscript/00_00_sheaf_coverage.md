# Sheaf Track Coverage {#sec:sheaf_coverage}

This page summarizes which **sheaf fragment tracks** are bound for each IMRAD row in `manuscript/sheaf/manifest.yaml`. The matrix is regenerated at compose time.

**Totals:** {{coverage_present}} present / {{coverage_bound}} bound / {{coverage_missing}} missing (gray).

| Color | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Black | Track **present** (bound and fragment exists) |
| White | **Absent** (not bound for this row) |
| Gray | **Missing** (bound but fragment file absent) |

Appendix row `16_appendix_full_sheaf.md` binds {{appendix_sheaf_track_count}} fragment track types as a composability proof (registry defines {{sheaf_track_count}} types; optional `layers` is methods-only).
