### Base poset and presheaf

The manuscript is modelled as a coverage sheaf over a finite base poset. Let the
**base** $P$ be the IMRAD blocks ordered as a chain,

$$
\mathsf{Introduction} \prec \mathsf{Methods} \prec \mathsf{Results} \prec \mathsf{Discussion} \prec \mathsf{Appendix},
$$ {#eq:imrad_chain}

with, in each block, a *group* node above its *section* nodes (written $G \sqsupseteq s$). $P$ is therefore a finite poset (equivalently a finite Alexandrov space). Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the registered fragment-track set from `manuscript/sheaf/tracks.yaml`; each track $t \in \mathcal{T}$ carries a renderer $R(t)$, label $L(t)$, optional flag $O(t)$, a general paper role $U(t)$, a section-use statement $V(t)$, and a strict compose-order index $\pi(t)$.

The **presheaf** $\mathcal{F}$ is a contravariant functor on $P$ — $\mathcal{F}\colon P \to \mathbf{Set}$ with restriction maps along $\sqsupseteq$ — assigning to each composing section $s$ its bound fragment set $\mathcal{F}(s) = \{\,(t, F_s(t)) : t \text{ bound in } s\,\}$, where $F_s : \mathcal{T} \rightharpoonup \mathbf{Path}$ is the section's partial binding map. Restriction along $G \sqsupseteq s$ is projection onto a section's own bindings; group nodes carry the empty assignment and do not compose.

The coverage cell is

$$
B(s,t) \in \{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{—}, \mathrm{M}\}
$$ {#eq:coverage_cell}

derived from $F_s(t)$ and filesystem existence at compose time: **P** when a bound fragment exists, **—** when the track is unbound for that row, and **M** when a bound path is missing. The current regenerated matrix reports {{coverage_present}} present / {{coverage_bound}} bound / {{coverage_missing}} missing cells. Registry size: $|\mathcal{T}| = {{sheaf_track_count}}$ types across {{imrad_manifest_rows}} IMRAD manifest rows ({{imrad_group_count}} group rows, {{composed_section_count}} composing sections).

### Verified sheaf laws

What makes this presheaf a *sheaf* — rather than a bare incidence table — is that the composer's structural axioms are machine-checked. The oracle `verify_sheaf_laws` (`src/manuscript/sheaf/laws.py`) verifies {{sheaf_law_count}} laws, and the regenerated build reports {{sheaf_laws_verified}}/{{sheaf_law_count}} satisfied:

1. **Poset.** The IMRAD blocks form the chain of [@eq:imrad_chain]; compose order is monotone in block rank and every composing section's block carries a group row.
2. **Presheaf (functoriality).** Every bound track lies in $\mathcal{T}$; $\pi$ is a strict total order; and each section's resolved track order is the monotone restriction of $\pi$ (an explicit `track_order` override must be a permutation of the section's bound tracks).
3. **Separation (locality).** The map $s \mapsto \mathrm{output\_name}(s)$ is injective over composing sections: distinct locals glue to distinct global positions, so the global section is unique.
4. **Gluing.** Compose order is a linear extension of $P$ — each block's rows are contiguous and strictly increasing in order — so the local fragments glue to a unique global manuscript in which every composing section appears exactly once.
5. **Typing.** Each binding $(t, F_s(t))$ is well-typed: $R(t)$ is a registered renderer and the fragment suffix lies in $R(t)$'s accepted suffix set. Generated renderers (`section_figures`, `layers_report`) synthesize their body and are explicitly type-exempt.
6. **Compositionality.** Every fragment file is private to one section (no path is bound twice), so global composition is the coproduct of the per-section bodies and is independent of inclusion order.

Each law is paired with a negative control in `tests/test_sheaf_laws.py` — a single mutation that breaks the law and is proven to be caught — so the gate binds the laws' *content*, not merely their shape. Under `--strict`, any violation is surfaced as an error-level manifest issue and aborts composition.

### Scope (what is and is not claimed)

These laws verify the sheaf *axioms* on a finite base poset. They do **not** compute sheaf *cohomology* ($H^0$/$H^1$, Čech complexes, derived functors); "sheaf" here names the verified separation-and-gluing structure of a multi-track coverage assignment, not a cohomological invariant. Formal track definitions and section×track bindings appear in the generated tables below.

Semantic gluing then checks agreement of the glued content: coverage counts, manuscript variables, typed claim predicates, pymdp mode/hash, Bernoulli GNN ontology, and SI T-maze GNN ontology. This certificate is a content-level audit over the same base, not an additional topological law.
