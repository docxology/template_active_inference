For each track $t \in \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Full}}$, the appendix row binds a fragment path $f(t)$ and the composer emits `<!-- sheaf-track:t -->` before the rendered body. Generated renderers such as `section_figures` and markdown renderers pass through the same `resolve_track_body()` dispatch, so the appendix exercises the common compose interface rather than a bespoke appendix path.

$$
|\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{Full}}| = {{appendix_sheaf_track_count}}
$$ {#eq:appendix_track_count}

The fragment registry defines {{sheaf_track_count}} composable track types; optional `layers` is bound on the methods sheaf section only. Optional `animation` is bound in this appendix proof; the deterministic GIF artifact in `tracks.yaml` `extension_tracks` is produced by the core analysis DAG and remains separate from this fragment slot.

Because this appendix binds every non-optional appendix track plus optional `animation`, it is the maximal publication stalk of the coverage presheaf and exercises every publication renderer through the common `resolve_track_body()` dispatch. The same compose path is gated by the {{sheaf_law_count}} sheaf laws verified in [@sec:methods_sheaf] ({{sheaf_laws_verified}}/{{sheaf_law_count}} satisfied): the appendix section glues to a unique output (separation), occupies the terminal position of the linear extension under its own `appendix` group row (poset and gluing), binds only well-typed fragments (typing), and owns every fragment path it references (compositionality). No count in this appendix is hand-written; all are injected from the registry-backed oracle.
