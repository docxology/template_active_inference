# Limitations and outlook {#sec:discussion_outlook}

<!-- sheaf-track:prose -->

## What this demonstrates

The result of this manuscript is a *discipline*, not a domain claim: across three toy models every reported number is hydrated from a generated artifact, {{sheaf_law_count}} sheaf axioms are machine-checked before composition, and {{counterexample_count}} negative controls keep each failure path live. That posture follows the caution that FEP and active-inference formalisms need explicit methodological scope before they become empirical brain claims [@gershman2019fepbrain]. No statistic, figure, or cross-track claim here can drift from its artifact without failing a gate before the PDF is built.

## Limitations

The Bernoulli–Ising toy, T-maze harness, and sheaf composition model are pedagogical. They validate analytical consistency, artifact wiring, renderer dispatch, and manuscript hydration, not empirical claims about biological agents. Default pymdp mode is `{{pymdp_mode}}` with planning horizon {{si_tmaze_policy_len}}; the policy-comparison artifact exposes policy-inference rows without changing the default rollout ([@sec:methods_pymdp]).

## Sheaf audit and outlook

[@sec:sheaf_coverage] and [@sec:appendix_full_sheaf] make binding state auditable under strict compose validation ([@sec:methods_sheaf]). Pipeline extensions in `tracks.yaml` `extension_tracks` now write deterministic artifacts: a belief GIF via `render_animation.py` and graph-world SI summary/trace via `simulate_si_graph_world.py`. The appendix row already binds an `animation` sheaf fragment without new manifest rows.

Sweep RMSE {{sweep_rmse_mi}} nats and SI goal reached {{si_goal_reached}} summarize measured agreement on the declared grids and rollout. Future work includes full expected-free-energy policy selection, richer graph-world rollouts, and expanded Lean proofs beyond the boundary witnesses in [@sec:methods_lean].

The discussion ontology binds `coverage_semantics` to the audit matrix in [@sec:sheaf_coverage], `pedagogical_scope` to the non-empirical scope of the toy models, and `state_inference_mode` to the pymdp harness contract in [@sec:methods_pymdp].

<!-- sheaf-track:simulation -->

Measured pymdp rollout (`{{pymdp_mode}}`, config hash `{{pymdp_config_hash}}`): mean belief entropy {{si_tmaze_mean_belief_entropy_formatted}} nats over {{si_tmaze_steps}} steps; goal reached flag {{si_goal_reached}}; action diversity {{si_action_diversity}}.

Analytical sweep residual RMSE {{sweep_rmse_mi}} nats (max residual {{sweep_max_residual}}). Coverage audit: {{coverage_present}} present / {{coverage_bound}} bound / {{coverage_missing}} missing cells on the IMRAD matrix.

<!-- sheaf-track:scholarship -->

The scholarship matrix is also a scope-control device. It separates conceptual
lineage from measured evidence: cited sources explain why the toy models are
relevant, while generated artifacts decide every numerical, figure, and gate
claim. That split keeps the paper from converting background authority into an
unsupported empirical result.

### Ontology bindings

- `coverage_semantics` → **Coverage matrix semantics**
- `pedagogical_scope` → **Pedagogical scope**
- `state_inference_mode` → **State inference harness**


<!-- sheaf-track:release_notes -->

### Release notes evidence track

The `release_notes` track keeps release-language claims source-backed by
validation, semantic, and bundle artifacts. Its evidence artifact is
`output/reports/release_notes_evidence.json`: it currently records
{{release_notes_row_count}} rows, with source-backed status
`{{release_notes_source_backed}}`.
