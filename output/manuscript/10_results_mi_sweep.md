# Mutual-information parameter sweep {#sec:results_mi_sweep}

<!-- sheaf-track:prose -->

We sweep coupling strength $\lambda$ on a grid of 21 points up to $\lambda_{\max} = 4$. Closed-form mutual information from [@eq:entangled_joint] is cross-checked against an independent exact recomputation via total correlation from the analytical module ([@sec:methods_analytical]); both are deterministic (no sampling) and agree to 0 nats.

Measured invariant checks: 12 / 12 passed on the clean tree.

<!-- sheaf-track:formalism -->

The sweep reuses the entangled joint defined in [@eq:entangled_joint] ([@sec:methods_analytical]). Mutual information $I(\lambda)=\log 2 - H_b(\sigma(\lambda))$ is evaluated on the same $\lambda$ grid as the analytical oracle and its independent exact recomputation.

<!-- sheaf-track:simulation -->

Both estimators are deterministic (no sampling, no RNG) and are evaluated on the same $\lambda$ grid as the closed-form sweep ([@sec:methods_analytical], [@fig:ising_mi_curve]).

*Reproduced from [@fig:ising_mi_curve]. Closed-form $I(\lambda)$ and an independent exact recomputation via total correlation for the symmetric Bernoulli-Ising toy across 21 grid points up to $\lambda_{\max}$ = 4; grid maximum 0.6031 nats. Both estimators are deterministic (no sampling), so the right panel is a cross-implementation agreement check (max residual 0 nats), not a sampling residual.*
