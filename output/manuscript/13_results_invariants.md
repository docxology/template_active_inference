# Validation invariants {#sec:results_invariants}

<!-- sheaf-track:prose -->

The analytical invariant registry runs before PDF rendering ([@sec:methods_analytical]). On a clean checkout **12 / 12** checks pass in the merged validation report, which records simulation invariants when the pymdp harness ran ([@sec:results_si_tmaze]).

[@fig:invariant_dashboard] lists each analytical and simulation gate; failures block publication artifacts. See [@sec:methods_sheaf] for how invariant counts hydrate manuscript tokens.

<!-- sheaf-track:simulation -->

Simulation invariants merge into the analytical report after the pymdp harness runs ([@sec:results_si_tmaze]). [@fig:invariant_dashboard] summarizes pass/fail status for both domains on the clean tree.

<!-- sheaf-track:replay_matrix -->

The replay matrix exposes deterministic rerun comparison as table data rather than prose. It contains 13 producer rows, uses explicit replay-or-fingerprint methods, and every row must match its saved artifact hash (`true`).

<!-- sheaf-track:sensitivity -->

The `sensitivity` fragment binds the deterministic toy sweep to the canonical sheaf track. `output/data/sensitivity_sweep.json` contains 96 cells across toy parameters, policy modes, seeds, horizons, and graph topologies; the hydrated flag `true` is the only manuscript claim about coverage.

The companion `output/data/si_policy_grid.json` records measured policy-mode rows derived from `si_policy_comparison.json`, not a synthetic grid. Missing cells fail the artifact schema before they can become prose; the topology trace artifact contributes 4 deterministic topology traces.

<!-- sheaf-track:uncertainty -->

The `uncertainty` fragment reports only normalized toy summaries. `output/data/uncertainty_summary.json` contains 12 belief and policy-posterior rows plus 3 finite entropy bins, and `true` is false if any posterior row fails to sum to one within the deterministic tolerance.

Policy uncertainty is recorded in generated policy artifacts rather than hand-entered into the manuscript. The posterior grid contributes 5 available posterior rows; the EFE values artifact reports availability-or-measured-fallback flag 1. The fragment is therefore a validation surface, not an empirical uncertainty claim.

<!-- sheaf-track:benchmark -->

The `benchmark` fragment adds a compact toy matrix over the Bernoulli, T-maze, and graph-world artifacts. `output/data/toy_benchmark_matrix.json` reports 3 model rows and `true` only when each row names an artifact, metric, and passing gate.

The matrix is scoped to deterministic exemplar models. It is useful as a cross-track smoke test, not as a performance benchmark for biological or deployed systems.

<!-- sheaf-track:state_space_catalog -->

### State-space catalog track

The `state_space_catalog` track enumerates finite state spaces, action spaces,
and policy counts for the deterministic toy models. The catalog artifact is
`output/data/state_space_catalog.json`: it currently records
6 rows, with finite-space status
`true`.

<!-- sheaf-track:causal_ablation -->

### Causal ablation track

The `causal_ablation` track records deterministic toy ablations over finite
preferences, likelihood-noise settings, and graph-topology perturbations. The
matrix artifact is `output/data/causal_ablation_matrix.json`: it currently
records 36 cells, with complete-grid status
`true`.
