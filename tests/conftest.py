    """Pre-warm gate artifacts only when the collected selection can use them.

    ``ensure_gate_artifacts`` (see ``gate_support.py``) memoizes its expensive
    full rebuild (pymdp policy sampling, figure generation, sheaf
    consolidation, GIF rendering) behind a content-signature cache that is
    genuinely fast (~0.01s) on every call *after* the first. But the first
    call alone measured ~250s on this machine -- well past the repo's real
    per-test timeout (``infrastructure.core.test_runner.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT =
    120``, forwarded as pytest's ``--timeout``). Whichever test happens to run
    first pays that cost inside its own timeout window and gets killed before
    the bootstrap finishes, so its cache marker never gets set -- the *next*
    test then retries the same never-completing bootstrap, cascading the
    failure across every test in the file (this is what made
    ``test_aggregate_forgery_controls.py`` fail wholesale rather than just its
    first test).

    Collection hooks run before pytest-timeout's per-item timer starts, so the
    cold bootstrap can run to completion here. If pymdp is
    unavailable, ``ensure_gate_artifacts`` calls ``pytest.skip(...)``, which
    is only meaningful inside a test's execution -- swallow it here and let
    each test's own ``ensure_gate_artifacts()`` call skip normally.

    The bootstrap (``compose_all_sections`` etc.) hydrates tracked
    ``manuscript/**/*.md`` sources as a side effect -- exactly what the
    ``_restore_mutable_project_sources`` fixture below exists to undo after
    each test. But that fixture's snapshot is only taken lazily, on the
    *first test's* setup phase; running the pre-warm here, before any test
    has started, would hydrate those files before the snapshot captures
    "original" content, permanently drifting the git-tracked source. Snapshot
    and restore the same mutable-source set around the pre-warm call so the
    real snapshot fixture still captures pristine content afterward. The
    signature cache this pre-warm populates is keyed on ``output/`` artifacts
    only (see ``_REQUIRED_GATE_ARTIFACTS``), not manuscript source, so
    restoring the manuscript files does not invalidate it.
    Focused ``test_*_direct.py`` runs operate exclusively on isolated project
    copies and never consume the real-tree gate cache.  Skipping the unrelated
    research-pipeline prewarm for those selections keeps their setup bounded;
    mixed and full-suite selections retain the one-time prewarm.
