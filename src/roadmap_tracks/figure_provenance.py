"""Figure source-provenance map for canonical sheaf-track gates.

Verifier-first helpers (PR#23): ``mapped`` is re-derived from the filesystem
rather than trusting a stored flag — a figure is mapped only when it has at
least one source and every listed source-code path exists. ``output/**``
artifact paths are deferred (produced later in the pipeline). The
``build_figure_source_map`` builder lives in ``integration_audit_artifacts``;
this module owns only the ground-truth recompute used by builder and validator.
