# template_active_inference

📦 **Archived on Zenodo.** The [Zenodo concept DOI for template_active_inference](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20417021) always resolves to the latest version; the current release **v0.3.1** is the [Zenodo version DOI for v0.3.1](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20693424). Each Zenodo deposit links back to its matching [GitHub release](https://github.com/docxology/template_active_inference/releases). Cite via the concept DOI or [`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff).

Public exemplar: **sheaf-composed** Active Inference manuscript with configurable
multi-track sections. The live surface is declared in [`tracks.yaml`](tracks.yaml),
[`manuscript/sheaf/tracks.yaml`](manuscript/sheaf/tracks.yaml), and
[`figures.yaml`](figures.yaml); generated artifacts and gates, not prose lists,
define the current contract.

## Run via the template monorepo

This exemplar lives at `projects/templates/template_active_inference/` in the public
[docxology/template](https://github.com/docxology/template) repository.
**Tests, analysis, PDF rendering, and CI all run through that monorepo** —
clone it, run `uv sync` at the repository root, then:

```bash
./run.sh --project templates/template_active_inference --pipeline --core-only
# or: uv run python scripts/execute_pipeline.py --project templates/template_active_inference --core-only
```

Several exemplars also publish standalone GitHub/Zenodo releases for citation;
those mirrors are outputs of this pipeline. The monorepo remains the canonical
build and render surface.

## When to use this template

Use this template when **several independent research tracks must compose into
one manuscript whose claims stay consistent where the tracks overlap** — here:
a closed-form analytical oracle, a pymdp simulation harness, a Lean
formalization boundary, and shared GNN/ontology notation. Every section of the
paper is a typed fragment bound to one or more tracks, and machine-checked
composition laws (not an editor's eyeball) prove the fragments glue into a
single coherent document. If your project is single-method, start from
[`template_code_project`](../template_code_project/) instead; for the full
roster see
[`projects/AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md#permanent-canonical-exemplars-and-optional-search-add-on).

## Why sheaf composition?

The problem: N tracks evolve independently (an analyst edits the closed-form
derivation while a simulation run regenerates posterior tables), yet the
manuscript must remain ONE document with no contradictions at the seams.
"Sheaf" here means exactly what the code enforces — a coverage presheaf over
the IMRAD section poset with law-verified gluing, not sheaf cohomology:

- **Locality** — each section×track binding is validated in isolation
  (fragment exists, renderer type-checks).
- **Gluing** — sections compose in a strict linear extension of the IMRAD
  order; every composing section appears exactly once.
- **Separation** — distinct sections cannot collide on one output file.
- **Semantic restriction** — symbols shared across tracks (e.g. the Bernoulli
  entropy value) are cross-checked in
  `output/data/sheaf_gluing_certificate.json`, so overlap consistency is an
  artifact, not a hope.

The six laws (poset, presheaf, separation, gluing, typing, compositionality)
live in [`src/manuscript/sheaf/laws.py`](src/manuscript/sheaf/laws.py), each
with a negative-control test that proves the law actually fires. See
[`src/manuscript/sheaf/README.md`](src/manuscript/sheaf/README.md) for the
engine's module map.

## Adding a track

1. Declare the track in
   [`manuscript/sheaf/tracks.yaml`](manuscript/sheaf/tracks.yaml) — id,
   `order` (global compose position), `renderer`, `label`, `optional` flag.
2. Bind it to sections in
   [`manuscript/sheaf/manifest.yaml`](manuscript/sheaf/manifest.yaml)
   (`tracks: {your_track: relative/fragment/path}` per section).
3. Create the fragment files under `manuscript/sections/imrad/<section>/`.
4. Validate the laws and coverage:
   `uv run python scripts/compose_manuscript.py --validate-only --strict`.
5. For a *validated* track (producer + artifact + gate + negative control),
   follow the seven-step promotion checklist in [`TODO.md`](TODO.md).

## Configuration

Use [`manuscript/config.yaml`](manuscript/config.yaml) as the live paper,
render, sheaf, analysis, testing, and publication metadata surface. Keep
[`manuscript/config.yaml.example`](manuscript/config.yaml.example) in parity
with the same top-level sections and replace project-specific values with
placeholder-safe starter values before forking or publishing a standalone copy.
Track and figure registries remain in `tracks.yaml`,
`manuscript/sheaf/tracks.yaml`, `manuscript/sheaf/manifest.yaml`, and
`figures.yaml`.

## Repository orientation

- [`docs/conceptual-foundations.md`](docs/conceptual-foundations.md) — the
  full intellectual grounding: Active Inference and EFE, cellular sheaves
  over the IMRAD poset, semantic gluing, the Lean 4 boundary, GNN/AIO
  notation contracts, and further reading.
- [`ISA.md`](ISA.md) — the project's Ideal State Artifact (design record and
  criteria history).
- [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) — backlog and the track promotion rule (a capability is
  live only when producer, artifact, manuscript consumer, claim evidence,
  semantic restriction, validation gate, and negative control all exist).
- [`STANDALONE.md`](STANDALONE.md) — how to copy this project out of the
  monorepo and run it independently (the sheaf engine under
  `src/manuscript/sheaf/` is deliberately generic; the registries are the
  bespoke part).
- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — module map and agent-facing contracts.

```

> Runtime: the gate-heavy suite is slow because real pandoc/xelatex rendering
> and artifact-generation tests dominate. Prefer `scripts/run_full_verification.py`;
> it now runs coverage in separate pytest chunks so source mutations and generated
> manuscript refreshes do not share one long session. For a fast inner loop, scope
> with `-k` (e.g. `uv run pytest tests/ -k "not gate and not figure" --no-cov`).

From repo root:

```bash
uv run python scripts/01_run_tests.py --project templates/template_active_inference

```

## Sheaf composition

Tracks are declared in [`manuscript/sheaf/tracks.yaml`](manuscript/sheaf/tracks.yaml) (order, renderer, optional). Sections bind fragments in [`manuscript/sheaf/manifest.yaml`](manuscript/sheaf/manifest.yaml). The composer merges them into flat `manuscript/0*.md` files for the PDF pipeline.

The first manuscript page ([`manuscript/00_00_sheaf_coverage.md`](manuscript/00_00_sheaf_coverage.md)) shows a **B/W/G heatmap** of section × track coverage (black = present, white = absent, gray = missing binding). Compose writes `output/data/sheaf_coverage_matrix.json` only; `generate_figures.py` renders the heatmap PNG and regenerates the coverage page via `ensure_coverage_artifacts`.

Hydration writes a semantic sheaf certificate at `output/data/sheaf_gluing_certificate.json`.
It also writes `output/data/sheaf_evidence_crosswalk.json` and
`output/data/validation_dependency_graph.json`. Together these artifacts bind shared
GNN/ontology symbols, typed claims, artifact producers, validation gates, and manuscript
variables so the project validates semantic agreement, not only coverage shape.
The promoted validation-spine and canonical roadmap artifacts cover provenance,
replay, counterexamples, toy sweeps, uncertainty summaries, benchmark rows,
finite model-checking witnesses, interop reports, semantic gluing, dependency
graphs, evidence-field indexing, release-bundle parity, theorem traceability,
gate ergonomics, scholarship source mapping, visualization-quality and statistical-bridge auditing,
track-lane promotion mapping, artifact-contract indexing, local security-posture auditing,
artifact diffing, Lean proof extraction, finite state-space
catalogs, causal ablations, artifact license checks, release-note evidence,
track-improvement scope, and adversarial/scope audits. Live track IDs are stable
canonical names; future work improves those tracks rather than adding `_vN`
siblings.

Section [`16_appendix_full_sheaf.md`](manuscript/16_appendix_full_sheaf.md) binds the appendix manifest row as a composability proof; live counts are injected through manuscript variables, not hand-authored in this README. Optional `layers` is methods-only; `animation` is bound in the appendix row as a sheaf fragment.

The reproducible rendering contract is documented in
[`docs/reference/rendering-reproducibility.md`](docs/reference/rendering-reproducibility.md):
authored fragments/configs generate deterministic data, figures, composed
Markdown, hydrated Markdown, PDF/web outputs, and copied root outputs through one
hydration boundary.
Visualization quality is checked as generated evidence, not prose: the audit
joins render metrics, source maps, figure hashes, section bindings, and
per-figure claim lanes in `output/data/figure_source_map.json` and
`output/reports/visualization_quality_audit.json`. The same audit now enforces
the shared typography/layout tokens from `figures.yaml`, rejects raw
font-size literals in figure generators, and classifies auxiliary visual outputs
that are intentionally outside the numbered manuscript registry.
Scholarship quality is checked the same way: `output/data/scholarship_source_matrix.json`
is rederived from bibliography entries, manuscript citation sections, sheaf
tracks, manifest sections, scope-boundary text, and evidence artifacts before a
source row can count as connected.
Security posture is also a generated contract:
`output/reports/security_posture_audit.json` separates enforced local controls
from deferred production-only obligations, scans tracked project source/config
surfaces for high-risk secret patterns, and drives
`output/figures/security_posture_map.png`.
The cross-artifact contract is centralized in
`output/data/artifact_contract_index.json`: each row binds producer, configured
script, pipeline/sheaf lanes, manuscript consumers, claim predicates,
validators, negative controls, freshness status, and copied-root parity. Its
publication figure, `output/figures/artifact_contract_map.png`, makes that
contract inspectable in the methods and appendix sheaf.

```bash
uv run python scripts/compose_manuscript.py --list-tracks
uv run python scripts/compose_manuscript.py --section methods_analytical --tracks prose,formalism
uv run python scripts/compose_manuscript.py --validate-only --strict
```

Per-section overrides: `track_order`, `include_tracks`, `exclude_tracks`. See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## pymdp anchor

T-maze sophisticated inference uses planning horizon `policy_len` from measured `si_tmaze_summary.json` (see manuscript variables). `simulate_si_tmaze.py` also writes `si_policy_comparison.json`, `pymdp_policy_posterior_grid.json`, and `pymdp_runtime_diagnostics.json`; the last file captures the known third-party JAX static-array warning and fails validation on unexpected construction warnings. Reference: [pymdp sophisticated_inference examples](https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp/tree/main/examples/experimental/sophisticated_inference). Logs: `output/logs/pymdp_runs.jsonl`.

## Pipeline tracks

See [`tracks.yaml`](tracks.yaml). **Pipeline:** required tracks are declared
there, including core analytical/pymdp/formal/notation/visual tracks plus the
canonical validation and audit producers. **Sheaf registry:** fragment types live
in [`manuscript/sheaf/tracks.yaml`](manuscript/sheaf/tracks.yaml); the appendix
binds the full proof row except `layers`, which is methods-only. Thin scripts in
[`scripts/`](scripts/) delegate to `src/` and write deterministic local artifacts
under `output/`; `scripts/README.md` names the current producers and
`scripts/validate_outputs.py` checks their generated contracts.

Non-blocking future work is tracked in [`TODO.md`](TODO.md); current publication claims remain confined to deterministic toy Active Inference artifacts.

## Method inventory

Every Python `def` and `class` under `src/` and `scripts/` is documented in the
generated reference [`docs/reference/method-inventory.md`](docs/reference/method-inventory.md).
Regenerate it after method, script, or module changes, then check it before
reporting verification status:

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_method_inventory.py --check
```

## Documentation verification

Run the documentation and artifact contract checks from this project root:

```bash
uv run python scripts/check_documentation_contract.py --check
uv run python scripts/run_full_verification.py
```

`run_full_verification.py` runs:

- preflight contract seeding:
  `compose_manuscript.py --validate-only --strict`, `z_generate_manuscript_variables.py`,
  `generate_figures.py`, `validate_outputs.py`, `check_documentation_contract.py --check`
- chunked verification batches for gate-heavy modules
- chunked `pytest` coverage passes with one combined coverage gate
  (`--cov=src --cov-fail-under=90`)
- postflight contract checks immediately after coverage

Use `--monolithic-coverage` only when diagnosing behavior that specifically
requires the legacy single pytest coverage process.

The inventory distinguishes inline docstrings from inventory fallbacks, so missing
docstrings remain visible without bloating internal helper code.
